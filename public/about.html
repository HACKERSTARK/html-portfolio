<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As a dedicated student and aspiring web developer, I embark on the journey of merging creativity with technology. Currently enrolled in [Your Course] at Vellore Institute of Technology, I am passionate about crafting digital experiences that resonate with users. My academic pursuits drive me to explore innovative solutions and stay abreast of the dynamic world of web development.</p>

<p>Beyond the digital realm, I channel my enthusiasm for strategic thinking into the realm of chess. A chess enthusiast, I find joy in the intricacies of the game, where each move is a calculated step towards victory. This love for strategy extends beyond the chessboard into my approach to problem-solving, both in academics and web development.</p>

<p>Adding a social dimension to my student life, I proudly serve as the Vice President of the Board Gamers Club at Vellore Institute of Technology. In this role, I foster a community of like-minded individuals, creating spaces for camaraderie and strategic fun. This experience not only hones my leadership skills but also reflects my commitment to building connections and fostering a sense of belonging within the college community.
